## Complete the tasks below:
A positive integer is called an Armstrong number (of order n) if:

```
abcd... = a**n + b**n + c**n + d**n + ...
```
In the case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because:

```
153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3
```

- Write a program to take input from user and show if armstrong or not
